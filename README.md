Conway's Game of Life
=====================

The Game of Life is an autonomous game that does not require any human interaction except for the initial grid sequence. The game can continue forever or it may end in one turn depending on the initial conditions. This program will play the Game of Life by taking in a text file with the initial cell conditions and manipulate the input in order to play. The grid is represented by a grid of X's and O's, where X is dead and O is alive.
